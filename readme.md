## Hi, and welcome to this repository
This is a repo for something I've planned to make. It's a 3D sidescrolling Classic Sonic fangame called _**Sonic Hyperstars**_.  
  
## When did I start thinking about it
The first time I decided to think about it when I imagined a Sonic Mania fangame with full moveset. This idea developed when I saw the success of Super Mario Bros. Wonder against Sonic Superstars, which led me to ask if Super Mario Bros. Wonder had some Sonic style in it, like sonic and his friends wall climbing (like in Sonic USB Online) and stomping (like Modern Sonic) and having interactive elemental shields and so on. So I decided to make a classic sonic 3D sidescrolling fangame but with better graphics (maybe Super Mario Bros. Wonder graphics, kinda, or maybe realistic graphics like Generations or Forces or something) and some (sort of) creative ideas. Some of the ideas may be a ripoff of Super Mario Bros. Wonder (as I'm afraid), but I just wanna get some ideas on my own.  
  
## Moveset
This game may feature some different options, like having 3 types of movements, like basic moveset (the classic one, of course, with sonic having a dropdash), some Super Mario Bros. Wonder moveset (with sonicy style, such as stomping (you know what I mean about stomping, It's just a modern Sonic style of stomping that you know) and wall climbing (Inspired by Sonic USB Online)) and the full customisable moveset (basically, a wide variety of different customisable abilities, a few examples for Sonic like: Air Recurling from Sonic Triple Trouble, Super Peel-Out (basically, from Sonic CD, or maybe replace it with the Strike Dash from Sonic Chaos; cuz it's too op), Insta-Shield (from Sonic 3 & Knuckles, also it would be cool if it was truly reimagined in 3D), Instant Spin-Dash (from Sonic Generations) and so on...).  
  
## Characters
The character cast will include 7 playable characters: Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Mighty, Ray, and finally, Trip. I'm still thinking about adding Fang to the playable cast. Maybe, when the player completes the game.  
  
## Ideas and Features
I had some ideas that I think may inspire me to make some new gimmicks, they're written on my Notes app (Samsung Notes, since I own a Samsung device). Some of these ideas are for example: QTEs like those in Modern Sonic games (Like Sonic Adventure and Sonic Generations) and Sonic 3 & Knuckles (like in Lava Reef Act 1, and well, chasing sequences), springs and boostpads to keep some momentum and flow (some would become used in funny ways, especially in loops üòÅ), Variable Autoscrolling Speed (like in Tails' Skypatrol, and trust me, this way to play autoscrolling levels is gonna be fun and challenging), and the Dynamic Camera feature from Sonic Generations (and maybe Sonic Generations' after-images used for Classic Sonic), Extended Camera from Sonic CD, Photo Mode (for taking screenshots), Day and Night Mode in the level select menu (which changes the instrumentation of the music), multiple island view modes on the level select menu (all islands together in one view (only when you have the level pack DLC, or when you finish Lava Reef Zone and Hidden Palace), one full island, isometric view and traditional 3D view) and DA Garden rhythm game, Pinch Mode for bosses (oh man, the bosses need some work, especially with the co-op), and also some neat secrets üòâ. Also, there's gonna be achievements (that can reward you with medals) and mod support.
I am also planning to add a mod about this fangame to Sonic Superstars once the fangame releases, and maybe to Super Mario Bros. Wonder, too, because why not üòÅ?  
  
## Story
I haven't thought of a plot yet, since I focused on gameplay while thinking of this game. So, I'm going to write the plot in the Discussions section when I figure it out.  
  
## Zones
And speaking about the zones, I think about remixing some of my favourite obscure zones in the entire Classic Sonic series, including the 8-bit games, as well as adding original zone concepts. The zones between parentheses are the zones that inspire the new ones. Those zones are:  
  
1.Diamond Peak Zone       (Emerald Hill Zone & Green Hills Zone)  
  
2.Skyhigh Bridge Zone     (Bridge Zone)  
  
3.Fluroscent Petals Zone      (totally original)  
  
4.Mineral Undergrounds Zone     (Quartz Quadrant Zone & Underground Zone)  
  
5.Pyramid Dunes Zone      (Sandopolis Zone)  
  
6.Coral Blades Zone       (Tidal Tempest Zone & Aquatic Ruin Zone & Marble Garden Zone & Rusty Ruin Zone)  
  
7.Glitter Mist Zone       (Diamond Dust Zone)  
  
8.Callipolis Zone         (totally original)  
  
- Lava Reef Zone          (from Sonic 3 & Knuckles, not original)  
  
- Hidden Palace Zone      (from Sonic 3 & Knuckles, not Sonic 2, not original)  
  
9.Twilight Rails Zone    (Sunset Park Zone)  
  
10.Luminous Park Zone     (totally original)  
  
11.Shooting Nexus Zone     (Starlight Zone & Gigalopolis Zone (or Gigapolis Zone))  
  
12.Metallic Wetforest Zone  (Mecha Green Hill Zone)  
  
13.Binary Circuit Zone    (Cyber Station Zone)  
  
14.Cosmic Celesty Zone   (Crystal Egg Zone & Sleeping Egg Zone)  
  
15.Egg Citadel Zone       (totally original)  
  
## Special and Bonus Stages
Special Stages will be races against Fang to the Chaos Emeralds across half-pipes, inspired mostly by Sonic 3D Blast (Saturn) special stages and Sonic 4 ep. 2 special stages. Each special stage will be divided to 3 phases , the first and second phases will be collecting set amount of rings as a normal half-pipe special stage, the third phase however, will be chasing a UFO with a Chaos Emerald, you can use dash-pads and red hoops to your advantage and try to prevent Fang to get to the Chaos Emerald while avoiding traps. Also, your rings will act as a timer.
In co-op, whoever gets the giant ring first is the lead in the first phase, and there are turn exchanges, too.  
And bonus stages are accessed when passing through checkpoints with 50 or more rings, or by using fruits, and they will be divided to six types:  
  
1.Blue Spheres: The player will enter into a 3D Blue Spheres stage collecting blue spheres and avoiding red spheres, and the stage becomes faster as time passes, when you progress further into these stages, you will see yellow spheres that lets you bounce, green spheres that turn to blue spheres, and pink spheres that teleport you to another parts of the stage, just like in Sonic Mania. At the end of every stage, you're rewarded with 5 medals. In co-op, the player who gets to the portal first is the one that collects blue spheres and rings. To access this type of stages, you need to have an amount of rings divisible by 5 (50, 55, 60, etc..).  
  
2.Bouncy Bonus Stages: The player will enter into a 2D stage filled with colourful springs and bouncy bars and bumpers (Inspired by Sonic 1 (8-bit) special stages), as the player bounces his way to the end as the timer counts down, collecting shields and rings and medals hidden throughout the stages, if the player manages to reach the end of the stage, he's rewarded with bonus points and 3 medals, and if not, the player gets out without having any bonus points or medals, and returns to the zone with the shield and medals the player collected. To access this type of stages, you need to have an odd amount of rings (51, 53, etc..) except if it's divisible by 5 (55, 65, etc..).  
  
3.Rocket Shoes Bonus Stages: The player will enter to a sky environment and travel through it with rocket shoes (Inspired by Sonic Chaos Rocket Shoes Special Stages) collecting rings and shields and some medals, until the energy of rocket shoes goes down. The player is rewarded by bonus points and 3 medals. To access this type of stages, you need to have an even amount of rings (52, 54, etc..) except if it's divisible by 5 (50, 60, etc..).  
  
4.Special Stages: Those stages are accessed through giant blue rings in the same act the player collected a Chaos Emerald in, and they are the same special stages, but for collecting medals, just like in Sonic Superstars, and there will be more of those stages and they will be harder than the normal special stages as you progress further. The player is rewarded by bonus points and five medals collected after proceeding through those stages.  
  
5.Act Fruit: Those stages are located between some zones (or maybe I'll make fruit acts for all zones) and only need a fruit (or two, or maybe three) to proceed. They are like fruit acts in Sonic Superstars, an arena full of rings, balloons, zone-specific gimmicks and etc.., where you can collect rings and earn medals to the end, and the player is rewarded with more rings, bonus points and the amount of medals collected.  
  
6.Portals: In an act, a portal opens at a specific area, and the player can enter this portal to collect bonus rings, and at the end, the player is teleported to another point of the act, It's just like in Sonic Superstars.  
  
- In every case, collecting 100 rings earn the player a medal, while getting 50000 score points earns the player 5 medals. Also, in co-op, the players are allowed to have different shields from bonus stages.  
  
## Multiplayer
Multiplayer, tho, I plan for a normal local multiplayer, but maybe there will be an online multiplayer, although I don't think so (idk why). But a lot of online fangames, like Sonic USB Online, encourage me to put online multiplayer, and also I am going to integrate competition mode (from Sonic 3 & Knuckles) and the 2P Player mode (from Sonic 2) and battle mode from Sonic Superstars, into one full battle mode, you can chose between normal characters and your customisable bots, as well as the ability to choose the stage you want by voting. Battle mode will also be compatible with the level pack DLC, so you're able to choose between the additional levels, too. You can also have teams in battle mode. In online mode, you're able to choose between two-team competitions and four-tag-team competitions, while you have 2 tag teams in offline mode (just make sure that nobody hits his partner üòÅüòâ). And for offline co-op, I think Sonic Superstars already has the best formula, but needs to be improved. For example, the lead needs to be highlighted (maybe by a crown) and the camera needs to be improved further, also make it interactive as well as bringing some tag actions from Sonic Advance 3, and have all the players go super when each of them has 50 rings, making bosses easy for single-player mode and vice versa, and how about, when a player gets hit, nobody else takes these rings except who lost them, with the exception of having one ring if that other player has no rings, and if the player had only one ring, nobody can touch it even if they have no rings. You get what I mean? There can be other improvements, too. Also I'm gonna see if online co-op will be included.  
  
## Collectibles
Collectables will be medals, just like Sonic Superstars, you can earn them through bonus stages, as well as special stages, and hidden throughout the level, and obtained by destroying a gold badnik and finishing the stage without retrying, or simply by collecting 100 rings, and I guess in certain cases and maybe by having 50000 score points? In Sonic Hyperstars, you won't be only spending medals on cosmetics for your battle bot only, your also gonna spend them for cosmetics for your characters, too, and they will appear in normal gameplay, too, as well as skins for your character. Also, they are going to be used to unlocking music for the DA Garden rhythm game, as well as some art and other extras (maybe, cuz I'm not sure about art and extras ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). There are also fruits hidden throughout zones, but you won't be able to collect them when finishing second acts, tho.  
  
## Engine and Framework
And the engine I'm gonna use, as I decided to use Unity, I will use Freedom Engine (made by marmitoTH). Or maybe I will make my own 2.5D Engine and post a repo for it separately as soon as I release this game, which I don't think it will happen.
